## The motivation behind

This project was to test what i've learned so far in python, but also to make a project of my own.
When we use tutorials we kind of just copy code to our screen, when we do one of our own, our idea and our code is completly different
I ended up with this idead and was able to code it trough almost alone, even though i googled some syntax and asked a person for an outside view
when i got stuck.
This project is something i really enjoyed doing and is something i intend to scale. By the time i learn databases and so on i will try to implement
 login and account memory. All the way trough a client application c:
